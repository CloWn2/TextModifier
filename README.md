# TextModifier
A program that modifies a text file.It gets a text file and writes a new file with the modified text.
This program uses regular expression and some basic python code.
It is not done yet because I still didn't make it to remove excess white space between scentences as it should.
The chat.txt file is the text to be modfied and NewChat.txt is the file to write the new text on.
There is probablly a better/more effective way to iretate over the text but thats what I came up with.
In this program I have used a dictionary in a project for the first time.
