# TextModifier
A program that modifies a text file.It gets a text file and writes a new file with the modified text.
This program uses regular expression and some basic python code.
The chat.txt file is the text to be modfied and NewChat.txt is the file to write the new text on.
There is probablly a better/more effective way to iretate over the text but thats what I came up with.
In this program I have used a dictionary in a project for the first time.
I forgot to change it so the first letter of each line/scentence will be an upper letter before uploading it so ill just do it in some other time.
